# BUAA_OOPre

This is BUAA's OO precursor course, which used to be called C++ and C# Programming (although it has nothing to do with C# at all, and the assignments are in Java).

Here are the guidelines for a total of 8 OOPre assignments for the academic year 2022, as well as the requirements related to code style, with my own code attached to each assignment.

The code is for reference only, do not plagiarize, there is no fluke in the duplication checking.

For formal code style, please refer to: [checkstyle - Checks (sourceforge.io)](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/checks.html)

For the real OO related please refer to: [guide_book_public](https://github.com/Ailsa99/guide_book_public)

这是BUAA的OO先导课程，过去叫做C++与C#程序设计（虽然和C#一点关系都没有，而且作业用的是Java）。

这里搬运了2022学年OOPre共8次作业的指导书，以及代码风格相关的要求，每次作业都附有我自己的代码。

代码仅供参考，切勿抄袭，在查重上没有侥幸可言。

正式的代码风格请参考：[checkstyle – Checks (sourceforge.io)](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/checks.html)
